### Ken's UI Engineering

**Freelancing**

- I craft modern, scalable, responsive web applications that deliver exceptional user experiences. My technical toolkit is carefully selected to include industry-leading technologies and frameworks, ensuring that each project meets and exceeds client expectations.

- I leverage React and TypeScript to build robust and maintainable user interfaces, while TailwindCSS and Material-UI provide the aesthetic and functional framework to ensure sleek and intuitive design. For more complex applications requiring full-stack capabilities, I utilize Next.js and Remix, which allow for versatile rendering strategies and streamlined routing.

- On the backend, my solutions are powered by Prisma with PostgreSQL and MongoDB, offering robust data management and scalability. For projects requiring custom backend logic, I integrate Django REST framework and Ruby on Rails, which enable rapid development and effective API services.

- My approach is to work closely with clients to understand their unique requirements and challenges, ensuring that every solution is a technical fit and strategically aligned with their business goals. Whether you're looking to build from scratch, enhance an existing platform, or require specific technical expertise, my freelance business is here to help you navigate the digital landscape with confidence and innovation.
