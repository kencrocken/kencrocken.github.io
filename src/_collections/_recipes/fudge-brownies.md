ingredients:
  - 1/2 cup (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter
  - 1 1/4 cups sugar
  - 3/4 cup Dutch-process cocoa
  - 1/2 teaspoon salt
  - 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
  - 1/2 tablespoon vanilla extract
  - 2 large eggs
  - 3/4 cups Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
  - 2 cups chocolate chips
instructions:
  - Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease a 9" x 13" pan.
  - In a medium-sized microwave-safe bowl, or in a saucepan set over low heat, melt the butter, then add the sugar and stir to combine. Reheat briefly, just till the mixture is hot, but not bubbling. It'll become shiny as you stir it. Heating the mixture a second time will dissolve more of the sugar, which will help produce a shiny top crust on your brownies.
  - Stir in the cocoa, salt, baking powder, and vanilla.
  - Add the eggs, stirring till smooth.
  - Add the flour and chips, stirring till smooth.
  - Spoon the batter into the prepared pan.
  - Bake the brownies for about 28 minutes, until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out dry (though it may have a few crumbs clinging to it).
  - Cool on a rack before cutting and serving.
