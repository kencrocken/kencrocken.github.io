##Today I learned

1. How to setup an informational site with RefineryCMS
2. Create a custom rake task and then steal one
3. I may have a touch of imposter syndrome

I have been working on a WordPress theme for the dharma center I attend. I started the site just like every other app I have done, but the more I thought about it - the more it just didn't seem to be a good fit.  
The site is really just informational and would need to be updated by members of the center. So, I switched from Rails to a WordPress.

In my random wanderings through things Rails and Ruby I came across the RailsCast for RefineryCMS. It would have worked fine for the project. Its something I will have to keep in my back pocket the next time a similar project comes along.

The RailsCast is good, but its cut off at a certain point for the subscription; though the tutorial seems to be walking through a RailsGuide, which is free.

###Custom Rake
I have been working on this site quite a bit ... not always posting, but trying out various styles and tweaking things here and there.  
One thing I wanted was a custom rake task to automate starting a new post.  As usual I did some googling and found some good tutorials on creating custom rake tasks. Though, why reinvent the wheel. JekyllBootstrap contains such a task, so I "borrowed" it ...

###Imposter Syndrome
I was listening to Building Phase podcast on Giant Robots, "A meat sack of imposter syndrome" I believe was the title.  I can relate.  You would think as you get older you would learn but it can be tough - and sometimes I just feel that I am not good enough for this, that or the other thing ...
