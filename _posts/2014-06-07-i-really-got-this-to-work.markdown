After months of fiddling for a minute here and a minute there, I got my Jekyll site up!

I just started from scratch again today, and to my surprise it really didn't take me all that long.  I had a site I banged out already and it was just a matter of cutting it to pieces and letting the magic of Jekyll put it back together.

Of course, I think the ease of which I was able to navigate comes from not only putting in sometime with Jekyll, but also I have been taking backend web development course at General Assembly.  Those dudes have really been helpful and its cleared a lot up.

So, I tip my hat to the instructors of the BEWD_DC_1.  Good show, fellas!

I'm not sure if they really wanted to unleash my random thoughts onto the world, but they'll just have to deal.
