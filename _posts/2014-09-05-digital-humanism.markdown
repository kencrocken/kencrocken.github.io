### Not that humanism, well yeah, but no ...  
I am talking about humanist in terms of humanities scholarsship.

>The humanities include ancient and modern languages, literature, philosophy, religion, and visual and performing arts such as music and theatre. Areas that are sometimes regarded as social sciences and sometimes as humanities include history, anthropology, area studies, communication studies, cultural studies, law and linguistics.

### The other humanism  
Then there is the philosophical or ethical position, Humanist.

>Humanism is a philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings, individually and collectively, and generally prefers critical thinking and evidence (rationalism, empiricism) over established doctrine or faith.

<cite>[Wikipedia, Humanism, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism)</cite>

### The Anti-Humanist  
So, there is a philosophical position, anti-humanist.

>In social theory and philosophy, antihumanism (or anti-humanism) is a theory that is critical of traditional humanism and traditional ideas about humanity and the human condition. Central to antihumanism is the view that concepts of "human nature", "man", or "humanity", should be rejected as historically relative or metaphysical.

### Humanist Anti-Humanist
There you have it - you can be an Anti-Humanist Humanist.  As I said though, this is more about the notion of humanities in the computational age.  

>namely, to teach and study, research and interpret language, literature, history, and other disciplines that examine human nature and seek to account for human experience.

And that's my goal - I would like to enable this communication.  When I was in law school I read Lawrence Lessig's _Code_ - a really interesting read, in that his point, broadly speaking, is that its not so much law that will control people's behavior but it will be code.

### I did my best  
The whole law thing just didn't pan out.  I had a tech law job, but it fell through during the first dot com bubble burst.  From them it was litigation at a small firm and my own practice - some of it rewarding, some of it a headache.  I suppose this is normal.  Now, I am a hired gun in D.C., it is work - but it is not the career.  The only motiviation is money.  Now I am looking for something a bit more.

I would like to help enable that communication, pave the way for those who have something to say about the human experience.
